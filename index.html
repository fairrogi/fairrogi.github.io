    <section id="scope">
        <p>Making research objects (ROs) such as data, code, or models, <a
                href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">FAIR &ndash; Findable, Accessible,
                Interoperable, and Reusable</a> &ndash; is an important building block towards reproducible research.
            This
            workshop will introduce GIScience researchers to the publication of FAIR ROs and show participants how to
            find and access them in repositories relevant for GIScience. During the workshop, we will discuss concrete
            ROs as examples to
            learn the "do's" and "dont's" of publishing FAIR ROs, while also giving researchers feedback to
            improve their publication practices. </p>

        <h2>Call for Contributions</h2>
        <p>Workshop participants who already have experience with the corresponding repositories will be invited to
            upload a FAIR RO to the community that will be created on Zenodo for this purpose. </p>
